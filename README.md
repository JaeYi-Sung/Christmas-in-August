</br>


### Design
#### Main View
For Christmas in August, I sketched ideas based on two images: "Summer" and "Christmas"</br>
From Summer, I use light blue background colors and bright corrections.</br>
From Christmas I use red color, snowflakes, trees, advent calendars, and ornament items.</br>


</br>
Logo: Red typography with snow </br>
</br>
Tree: As the biggest symbol of Christmas, the tree is the main image for this album.</br>
Therefore, the tree's ornament was symbolized for and icons are related to the songs. </br>
Clicking on each icon plays the corresponding song. </br>
Also, balls with the members‚Äô symbolic colors were hung on the tree. </br> 
</br>
Advent Calendar: Each of these activities contains the context of being a precious gift </br>
in the sense of receiving gifts every day while waiting for Christmas. </br>
When the icons on the calendar are clicked on, </br>
it will be connected to the videos of the album one by one. </br>
</br>
Member Ball: These balls were hanging on the tree. </br>
The order and composition of balls were taken from the choreography movement. </br>
When clicked, it connects to each member page.</br>
